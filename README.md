## :rocket: Introduction

### Key Benefits 
- **Local Control and Cloud Capability** ‚Äì Allow full local  control and datapoint access while retaining the ability of Viessmann Cloud and App access.
- **Viessmann Heating/Heat Pump Compatibility** ‚Äì Works with Vitodens, Vitocal, Vitocrossal and most other Optolink featured devices.
- **Smart Home Ready** ‚Äì Integrates with **Home Assistant**, **ioBroker**, **Node-RED** or any other system with MQTT Support.
- Supports **VS2 and VS1/KW protocols** with different branches.  
  - The [vs1test branch](https://github.com/philippoo66/optolink-splitter/tree/vs1test) enables **VS1/KW protocol support** but works **only without** Vitoconnect.  
  - For **VS1/KW with Vitoconnect**, the [viconn-listener](https://github.com/philippoo66/viconn-listener) is available (currently in beta).

## :file_folder: Software Requirements
- Python (version >= 3.9):
  - pyserial: `pip install pyserial`
  - MQTT (version >= 2.0): `pip install paho-mqtt` 
- Virtual environments recommended ([Guide](https://github.com/philippoo66/optolink-splitter/wiki/510-error:-externally%E2%80%90managed%E2%80%90environment-%E2%80%90%E2%80%90-venv)).

## :desktop_computer:	Hardware Requirements
- Raspberry Pi or a suitable system.
- Viessmann Optolink-compatible heating (Vitodens, Vitocal, Vitocrossal, etc.).
- Optolink r/w head:
  - Original Viessmann model or self-made.
  - Volksz√§hler-compatible versions may work if LED distance is adjusted ([8‚Ç¨ option](https://www.ebay.de/itm/285350331996)).
- To retain **ViCare App functionality**, use a USB-to-TTL adapter:
  - Recommended: CP2102 chip ([Example](https://www.google.com/search?q=cp2102+usb+ttl)).
  - Some newer Vitoconnect models may work with FTDI chips.
  - **Raspberry Pi UART voltage = 3.3V** ‚Üí Set jumper accordingly!

## :hammer_and_wrench: Installation
### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/philippoo66/optolink-splitter.git
cd optolink-splitter
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies

Using a virtual environment is recommended to keep dependencies isolated and avoid conflicts with system-wide packages. More details can be found in [this guide](https://github.com/philippoo66/optolink-splitter/wiki/510-error:-externally%E2%80%90managed%E2%80%90environment-%E2%80%90%E2%80%90-venv).

#### 2.1. Create & activate the virtual environment:
```sh
python3 -m venv myvenv
python3 source myvenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: myvenv\Scripts\activate
```

#### 2.2. Install required dependencies:
```sh
pip install pyserial
pip install paho-mqtt  # Only if MQTT is used
```
*NOTE:* After installation, the environment must be activated before running the script.

### 3. Configure the Settings
Modify `settings_ini.py` according to your heating (/ datapoints):
- Refer to [Wiki | Parameter Addresses](https://github.com/philippoo66/optolink-splitter/wiki/310-Parameter-Addresses), [poll_list samples](https://github.com/philippoo66/optolink-splitter/wiki/350-Poll-Configuration-Samples)
- Refer to [Wiki | ViessData21](https://github.com/philippoo66/ViessData21?tab=readme-ov-file#dp_listen_2zip)

### 4. Run the Script
```sh
python3 source myvenv/bin/activate  # Make sure to activate the virtual environment. On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
python3 optolinkvs2_switch.py
```
For automatic startup, set up a service. See the [Wiki Guide](https://github.com/philippoo66/optolink-splitter/wiki/120-optolinkvs2_switch-automatisch-starten).

## :electric_plug: Connecting Optolink & Vitoconnect
### Parallel use with Vitoconnect / ViCare App
- Ensure the **serial port is enabled** and **serial console is disabled** ([Guide](https://github.com/philippoo66/optolink-splitter/wiki/050-Prepare:-enable-serial-port,-disable-serial-console)).
- **CP2102 Interface:**
  - Cross **RX/TX** lines.
  - Set voltage jumper to **3.3V**.
  - Use `ttyAMA0` instead of `ttyS0` for Raspberry Pi 3+ ([Details](https://github.com/philippoo66/optolink-splitter/wiki/520-termios.error:-(22,-'Invalid-argument'))).

### Vitoconnect Interfaces
#### **Vitoconnect 100 OPTO1**
To ensure proper communication with the system, follow the power-on sequence exactly:
1. **Connect all wires and plugs** to the Raspberry Pi and Vitoconnect.
2. **Power on the Raspberry Pi**.
3. Run the script and wait for the prompt: `awaiting VS2...`.
4. **Power on Vitoconnect 100 OPTO1**.

#### **Vitoconnect OPTO2**
The startup sequence for this device is not critical, as it will automatically reconnect without issues.

## :receipt: Command Syntax: MQTT & TCP/IP
Optolink Splitter can connect to an **MQTT Broker** for sending commands and receiving responses. Alternatively, a direct **TCP/IP connection** (e.g. using PuTTY) can be established to interact with the application directly. For more details on the command syntax, see the [Wiki | Command Syntax Overview](https://github.com/philippoo66/optolink-splitter/wiki/010-Command-Syntax) or go directly to the section on [MQTT and TCP/IP requests](https://github.com/philippoo66/optolink-splitter/wiki/010-Command-Syntax#command-syntax-for-requests-via-mqtt-and-tcpip).


  - read ambient temperature, scaled with sign:
    - cmnd = read;0x0800;2;0.1;true
    - resp: 1;2048;8.2

  - read DeviceIdent as raw:
    - cmnd = read;0xf8;8
    - resp: 1;248;20CB1FC900000114

  - write hotwater temperature setpoint:
    - cmnd = write;0x6300;1;45
    - resp: 1;25344;45

**Important Note for TCP/IP Connections:**  
When using PuTTY or similar software for a TCP/IP connection, the session must be closed by sending `exit` as a string, as PuTTY does not appear to send the FIN flag to properly terminate the session when closing.

## :house: Smart Home Integration (e.g. Home Assistant)
Optolink Splitter seamlessly integrates into your smart home setup via **MQTT**, allowing you to monitor and control your Viessmann heating system using platforms like **Home Assistant**, **ioBroker**, or **Node-RED**. All available heating system data can be visualized in dashboards, automated with custom rules, and integrated into broader smart home routines. With Optolink Splitter‚Äôs command-sending capability, you can locally adjust heating modes, temperature setpoints, or pump states directly from your favorite smart home system.

For detailed **Home Assistant integration instructions**, see the [Wiki | Home Assistant Integration of Optolink‚ÄêSplitter](https://github.com/philippoo66/optolink-splitter/wiki/210-Home-Assistant-Integration-of-Optolink%E2%80%90Splitter).  

Below are examples of how this integration looks in different smart home environments:
